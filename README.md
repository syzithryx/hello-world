My first repository as per the tutorial's instructions. I guess it's kinda like a profile page.

# About me
I was born in a manger on Christmas Eve - wait, no, wrong person - I mean, I was born 15 years and three months before the end of the world according to Mayan prophecy, which they must have miscalculated because Trump wasn't elected until 2016. Eww, I just broke Godwin's Law version 2, and only a line into my self-description! How terrible!

Anyway, I have the worst case of scatter-brain imaginable and am interested in basically everything, switching between semi-random obsessions on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis (you see, my obsessions form a nice nested tree diagram...) - but I do usually go back to things *eventually*. I've done abstract digital art, dark ambient music, flash fiction, poetry, abortive attempts at game design, lots of little Python programs for things I'd rather not do by hand, two different instances of worldbuilding pronounced "utterly wacko" by a friend (one is a tidally locked planet ruled by steampunk dragons and a fungal bio-internet, the other is Lovecraftian Earth but with Neanderthals, vampires, an afropunk technoshaman, and thiotimoline!), oh yes and I invent my own languages - *kag ve yev azaen sao?* (doesn't everyone also do that?)

Why am I here? Well, various people keep bugging me about how much I'd love it, though I'm mystified by that. I'm not a programmer; I just happen to do programming sometimes. That said, one of my great earth-shaking ambitions (of which there are several dozen) is to construct an open-source platform for collaborative development of and interaction within virtual spaces merged seamlessly with the physical world via AR, so that I could explore the whole planet and make friends in every country without having to leave my comfort zone (aka my bedroom)! Doing so, however, would likely require 1. actual work, 2. actual programming skill, and 3. other people, so maybe I should be here after all!

TL;DR: I like talking about myself!
